# ee562_wfq

This is a simple WFQ simulator based on a naive Descrite Event Simulation (DES) approach. This is my own sole work that I did
while preparing for the exam and diving deeper into the topic of WFQ.

The implementation of WFQ is based on the descriptions given in the lecture notes of the course "EE562: Network Stack Implementation"
by Prof. Martin Collier at DCU. I did not use any external sources to write this code.

Feel free to use this code for your own purposes. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please let me know.
